## Sentiment Analysis on Tokopedia App Reviews
As part of the Coding Camp powered by DBS Foundation, I developed a sentiment analysis project based on Tokopedia app reviews scraped from the Google Play Store.

This project aimed to classify user reviews into positive or negative sentiment, leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning models.

Key activities:
- Scraped and collected Tokopedia user reviews using web scraping tools.
- Conducted text preprocessing, including case folding, stopword removal, tokenization, and stemming.
- Visualized review keywords using Word Cloud to highlight frequently mentioned terms.
- Built and trained sentiment classification models using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Performed model evaluation using accuracy metrics.
- Implemented an inference pipeline to predict sentiment from new input reviews.

This project sharpened my skills in NLP, model training, and deployment fundamentals, giving me hands-on experience in transforming raw textual data into actionable insights.
